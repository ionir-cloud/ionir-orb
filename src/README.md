# Ionir Enabled Private Workers
ionir delivers high-speed persistent data to Kubernetes applications. Developers access data through standard APIs and familiar coding conventions, never again concerning themselves with where data is stored, or how it's protected. Like all resources in Kubernetes, with ionir, data just is.

Instantly access data as it existed at previous points in time - no complex snapshots or backups to manage, just request a timestamped volume (via code!). ionir is a tardis for data. Likewise, request data be copied across clusters - to burst or migrate, for example - and access a fully read-write capable in 40 seconds. ionir is a data transporter.
